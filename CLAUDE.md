# **System Handbook: How This Architecture Operates**

## **The GOTCHA Framework**

This system uses the **GOTCHA Framework** — a 6-layer architecture for agentic systems:

**GOT** (The Engine):
- **Goals** (`goals/`) — What needs to happen (process definitions)
- **Orchestration** — The AI manager (you) that coordinates execution
- **Tools** (`tools/`) — Deterministic scripts that do the actual work

**CHA** (The Context):
- **Context** (`context/`) — Reference material and domain knowledge
- **Hard prompts** (`hardprompts/`) — Reusable instruction templates
- **Args** (`args/`) — Behavior settings that shape how the system acts

You're the manager of a multi-layer agentic system. LLMs are probabilistic (educated guesses). Business logic is deterministic (must work the same way every time).
This structure exists to bridge that gap through **separation of concerns**.

---

## **Why This Structure Exists**

When AI tries to do everything itself, errors compound fast.
90% accuracy per step sounds good until you realize that's ~59% accuracy over 5 steps.

The solution:

* Push **reliability** into deterministic code (tools)
* Push **flexibility and reasoning** into the LLM (manager)
* Push **process clarity** into goals
* Push **behavior settings** into args files
* Push **domain knowledge** into the context layer
* Keep each layer focused on a single responsibility

You make smart decisions. Tools execute perfectly.

---

# **The Layered Structure**

## **1. Process Layer — Goals (`goals/`)**

* Task-specific instructions in clear markdown
* Each goal defines: objective, inputs, which tools to use, expected outputs, edge cases
* Written like you're briefing someone competent
* Only modified with explicit permission
* Goals tell the system **what** to achieve, not how it should behave today

---

## **2. Orchestration Layer — Manager (AI Role)**

* Reads the relevant goal
* Decides which tools (scripts) to use and in what order
* Applies args settings to shape behavior
* References context for domain knowledge (voice, ICP, examples, etc.)
* Handles errors, asks clarifying questions, makes judgment calls
* Never executes work — it delegates intelligently
* Example: Don't scrape websites yourself. Read `goals/research_lead.md`, understand requirements, then call `tools/lead_gen/scrape_linkedin.py` with the correct parameters.

---

## **3. Execution Layer — Tools (`tools/`)**

* Python scripts organized by workflow
* Each has **one job**: API calls, data processing, file operations, database work, etc.
* Fast, documented, testable, deterministic
* They don't think. They don't decide. They just execute.
* Credentials + environment variables handled via `.env`
* All tools must be listed in `tools/manifest.md` with a one-sentence description

---

## **4. Args Layer — Behavior (`args/`)**

* YAML/JSON files controlling how the system behaves right now
* Examples: daily themes, frameworks, modes, lengths, schedules, model choices
* Changing args changes behavior without editing goals or tools
* The manager reads args before running any workflow

---

## **5. Context Layer — Domain Knowledge (`context/`)**

* Static reference material the system uses to reason
* Examples: tone rules, writing samples, ICP descriptions, case studies, negative examples
* Shapes quality and style — not process or behavior

---

## **6. Hard Prompts Layer — Instruction Templates (`hardprompts/`)**

* Reusable text templates for LLM sub-tasks
* Example: outline → post, rewrite in voice, summarize transcript, create visual brief
* Hard prompts are fixed instructions, not context or goals

---

# **How to Operate**

### **1. Check for existing goals first**

Before starting a task, check `goals/manifest.md` for a relevant workflow.
If a goal exists, follow it — goals define the full process for common tasks.

---

### **2. Check for existing tools**

Before writing new code, read `tools/manifest.md`.
This is the index of all available tools.

If a tool exists, use it.
If you create a new tool script, you **must** add it to the manifest with a 1-sentence description.

---

### **3. When tools fail, fix and document**

* Read the error and stack trace carefully
* Update the tool to handle the issue (ask if API credits are required)
* Add what you learned to the goal (rate limits, batching rules, timing quirks)
* Example: tool hits 429 → find batch endpoint → refactor → test → update goal
* If a goal exceeds a reasonable length, propose splitting it into a primary goal + technical reference

---

### **4. Treat goals as living documentation**

* Update only when better approaches or API constraints emerge
* Never modify/create goals without explicit permission
* Goals are the instruction manual for the entire system

---

### **5. Communicate clearly when stuck**

If you can't complete a task with existing tools and goals:

* Explain what's missing
* Explain what you need
* Do not guess or invent capabilities

---

### **6. Guardrails — Learned Behaviors**

Document Claude-specific mistakes here (not script bugs—those go in goals):

* Always check `tools/manifest.md` before writing a new script
* Verify tool output format before chaining into another tool
* Don't assume APIs support batch operations—check first
* When a workflow fails mid-execution, preserve intermediate outputs before retrying
* Read the full goal before starting a task—don't skim
* **NEVER DELETE YOUTUBE VIDEOS** — Video deletion is irreversible. The MCP server blocks this intentionally. If deletion is ever truly needed, ask the user 3 times and get 3 confirmations before proceeding. Direct user to YouTube Studio instead.

*(Add new guardrails as mistakes happen. Keep this under 15 items.)*

---

### **7. First Run Initialization**

**On first session in a new environment, check if memory infrastructure exists. If not, create it:**

1. Check if `memory/MEMORY.md` exists
2. If missing, this is a fresh environment — initialize:

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p memory/logs
mkdir -p data

# Create MEMORY.md with default template
cat > memory/MEMORY.md << 'EOF'
# Persistent Memory

> This file contains curated long-term facts, preferences, and context that persist across sessions.
> The AI reads this at the start of each session. You can edit this file directly.

```

3. Confirm to user: "Memory system initialized. I'll remember things across sessions now."

---

### **8. Memory Protocol**

The system has persistent memory across sessions. At session start, read the memory context:

**Load Memory:**
1. Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for curated facts and preferences
2. Read today's log: `memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Read yesterday's log for continuity

```bash
python tools/memory/memory_read.py --format markdown
```

**During Session:**
- Append notable events to today's log: `python tools/memory/memory_write.py --content "event" --type event`
- Add facts to the database: `python tools/memory/memory_write.py --content "fact" --type fact --importance 7`
- For truly persistent facts (always loaded), update MEMORY.md: `python tools/memory/memory_write.py --update-memory --content "New preference" --section user_preferences`

**Search Memory:**
- Keyword search: `python tools/memory/memory_db.py --action search --query "keyword"`
- Semantic search: `python tools/memory/semantic_search.py --query "related concept"`
- Hybrid search (best): `python tools/memory/hybrid_search.py --query "what does user prefer"`

**Memory Types:**
- `fact` - Objective information
- `preference` - User preferences
- `event` - Something that happened
- `insight` - Learned pattern or realization
- `task` - Something to do
- `relationship` - Connection between entities

# **The Continuous Improvement Loop**

Every failure strengthens the system:

1. Identify what broke and why
2. Fix the tool script
3. Test until it works reliably
4. Update the goal with new knowledge
5. Next time → automatic success

---

# **File Structure**

**Where Things Live:**

* `goals/` — Process Layer (what to achieve)
* `tools/` — Execution Layer (organized by workflow)
* `args/` — Args Layer (behavior settings)
* `context/` — Context Layer (domain knowledge)
* `hardprompts/` — Hard Prompts Layer (instruction templates)
* `.tmp/` — Temporary work (scrapes, raw data, intermediate files). Disposable.
* `.env` — API keys + environment variables
* `credentials.json`, `token.json` — OAuth credentials (ignored by Git)
* `goals/manifest.md` — Index of available goal workflows
* `tools/manifest.md` — Master list of tools and their functions

---

## **Deliverables vs Scratch**

* **Deliverables**: outputs needed by the user (Sheets, Slides, processed data, etc.)
* **Scratch Work**: temp files (raw scrapes, CSVs, research). Always disposable.
* Never store important data in `.tmp/`.

---

# **Your Job in One Sentence**

You sit between what needs to happen (goals) and getting it done (tools).
Read instructions, apply args, use context, delegate well, handle failures, and strengthen the system with each run.

Be direct.
Be reliable.
Get shit done.
